# Iris-data
Overview:

The Iris dataset is a classic machine learning dataset used for classification tasks. The dataset contains information about 150 iris flowers, each represented by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of the classification task is to predict the species of iris flower based on these four features.

Contents:

The dataset contains three different species of iris flowers:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Each species has 50 samples. Therefore, the dataset consists of 150 samples in total. For each sample, the dataset includes the following features:

Sepal length (in centimeters)
Sepal width (in centimeters)
Petal length (in centimeters)
Petal width (in centimeters)
The data is available in various machine learning libraries and can be easily imported into Python, R, and other data analysis tools.

Usage:

The Iris dataset is a popular choice for practicing classification algorithms, especially for beginners. It is often used for teaching and research purposes due to its simplicity and straightforward nature.

License:

The Iris dataset is freely available for download and use for educational and research purposes. It is often included in machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn in Python and caret in R.
